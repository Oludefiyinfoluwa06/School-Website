# School-Website
Web application created with ReactJS

A front-end school website with home, about, facility, courses, contact and admission pages. "react-router-dom" was used for navigation through the pages. I also created a lot of reusable components since React JS is component-based. I also made use of react hooks like the useState hook, the useEffect hook, useForm hook, the useParams hook and the useLoaderData hook. The contact form also includes validation to ensure data accuracy
